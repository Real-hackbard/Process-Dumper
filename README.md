A process dump is a file containing a snapshot of the memory and state of a running process at a specific point in time. It is used to analyze problems such as crashes, performance bottlenecks, or freezes. Dumps can be created manually via Task Manager or with dedicated tools like ProcDump, but can also be created automatically in the event of exceptions or freezes. The resulting .dmp files are then analyzed with debugging tools like Visual Studio to find the cause of a problem.

### Snapshot:  
A dump file is essentially a copy of a process's entire memory and state information.

### Purpose:  
Dumps are used for debugging applications, especially in production environments when a direct debugger connection is difficult.

### Content:  
A dump file contains information about the process's state, such as memory, variables, thread information, and the execution stack.

### Debugging:  
Dumps are valuable for finding the root cause of application problems that are difficult to reproduce, reports Microsoft Learn.

### Performance analysis:  
They can be used to investigate why a process is using too much CPU or has become unresponsive.

### Crash analysis:  
By analyzing the dump file, developers can reconstruct the state of the application at the time of the crash.

Process dumper is a program that saves data from the computer's memory, usually from a foreign process (program) to a (*.dmp) file. Often the process's memory is dumped automatically to disk if the program crashes. You may recover any unsaved data from this file or send it to the developer so he can investigate what caused the crash.

Another use of 'dumpers' can be dumping Windows Exe-files from memory after they have been unpacked/[decrypted](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Encryption) for further analysis (in case of [Malware](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Malware), or after unwrapping/unpacking certain security [envelopes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Envelope). These security envelopes are applied by the developer or software vendor to 'protect' these applications.

### Resource:  

In Microsoft Windows, a resource is an identifiable, read-only chunk of data embedded in an executable fileâ€”specifically a PE file.
Files that contain resources include: EXE, DLL, CPL, SCR, SYS and MUI files.
The Windows API provides a computer program access to resources.

Each resource has a type and a name, both being either numeric identifiers or strings.
Windows has a set of predefined resource types:

The programmer can also define custom data types.
